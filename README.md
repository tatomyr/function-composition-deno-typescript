# Function combination & Deno & Typescript

Playing around with some funny things

# Development

Install [deno](https://deno.land/).

Use [deno extention for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justjavac.vscode-deno).

Using **Prettier** may require manual formatting 
(since deno extension takes precedence but I haven't figured out how to grant it the permissions).
Use _Cmd + Shift + P -> Format Document With... -> Prettier_.

# Testing

Run `deno match.test.ts`. Testing docs are here: https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/tree/master/testing
